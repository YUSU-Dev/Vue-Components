# Vue - Components

This Repo contains the activities vue component which interacts with Sums' [Pluto API](https://github.com/University-of-Lincoln-SU/External-Developer-Docs/tree/master/PlutoAPI)

You will need to include the following scripts:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script src="location-where-comp-is-stored.js"></script>
<script>
    var app = new Vue({
        el: '#main'
    });
</script>
```
