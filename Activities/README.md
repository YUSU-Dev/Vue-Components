# Vue - Activities Components

This Repo contains the activities vue component which interacts with Sums' [Pluto API](https://github.com/University-of-Lincoln-SU/External-Developer-Docs/tree/master/PlutoAPI)

You will need to include the following scripts:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script src="location-where-comp-is-stored.js"></script>
<script>
    var app = new Vue({
        el: '#main'
    });
</script>
```

## Vue A-Z Component
You can then use following code anywhere you want to use the component.

```
<div id="main">
    <v-activities-a-z siteid="" />
</div>
```

The component will load 25 activities at a time. More activites can be fetched by clicking the included "load More" button.

Activities are sorted by name.

## Vue Random Activity Component
You can then use following code anywhere you want to use the component.

```
<div id="main">
    <v-random-activity siteid="" />
</div>
```

The component will create a button that will link to a random componant each time the page is refreshed.

The included index.html document can be used for local testing.
